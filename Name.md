Our algorithm includes two steps:

Step 1: generate matrices

Step 2: matrix multiply

Use the following rule to Name *.cpp:

1. For hybrid model: 

Step 1: gm_sparse_phoenix.cpp

Step 2: mm_sparse_graphchi.cpp

2. For phoenix:

Step 1: gm_dense_phoenix.cpp

Step 2: mm_dense_phoenix.cpp

3. For grapchi:

Step 1: gm_sparse_graphchi.cpp

Step 2: mm_sparse_graphchi.cpp
